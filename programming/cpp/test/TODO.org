* (Unions)
** See test.cpp, specifically the portion of main() where I am giving an example of a union
* (std::cout) 
** Understand how to print out a number to a precise type.
   Specifically, look at the 'classes-functions.cpp' file where I try to print a double and it rounds to the nearest integer
