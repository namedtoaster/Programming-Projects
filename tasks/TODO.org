** Installing from source
*** Holy cow, I have had so many issues with trying to install stuff. Usually, I just end up randomly installing stuff and I don't even know where it goes or how to fix it. I especially had alot of issues when I was trying to load a png file in my SDL test. I need to figure this stuff out so I can better debug issues in the future
** OS errors
*** Investigate how apport works. Possibly create a script to autoremove all files in /var/crash/
