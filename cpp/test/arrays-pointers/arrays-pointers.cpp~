  // first character in the string with a null terminator
  const char * foo = "hello";
  printf("This is a string literal: %s\n", foo);
  printf("This is the address of the string literal: %p\n", &foo);

  int w = 10;
  a = &w;
  // Printing a pointer variable prints its address
  printf("Address of a: %p\n", a);
  // Printing what a pointer refernces does just that: prints the
  // value located at the address it points to
  printf("Value of a: %d\n", *a);
  

  // Sometimes pointeres need to point to nothing. I'm not sure what
  // those cases are, but apparently there exists a use
  int * x = 0;
  x = nullptr;
  // Now what happens when I try to print x?
  cout << x << endl;
  // Somewhat unsurprsingly, it just prints 0. Keep in mind that the
  // initialization and assignment of x in the previous lines assign
  // the same exact value to x.

  // Convert string to lower case test
  string test = "Post-It Notes";
