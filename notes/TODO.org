* Emacs
** Notifications
There are a few applications that you can install on emacs that will
allow you to send notifications to the desktop. I'm mostly interested
in getting notifications on things like agenda items, but I'd also be
interested to see what else there is out there
** Agenda
Eventually, I'll add my personal weekly goals to Emacs
