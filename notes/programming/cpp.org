#+TITLE: Miscellaneous notes about the C++ programming language to include best practices and explanation of concepts (note: most explanations accompany the files in the test directory)

* Best practices
** const char* VS. char*

It seems the preferred way of manipulating a string data type in C++
is via the const char* type. Reason for this is simply because you
shouldn't be able to modify a string literal.

(In the zoo_animals.cpp file (in the OOP/Purdue_exercies dir), it was
possible to cast a string literal as a char* for some reason. I don't
think this should be possible).

To get a better explanation (I don't know words) see this
