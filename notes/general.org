#+TITLE: General notes on various computer/programming/Linux related topics

* Scripts
** Backup script
See https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/backup-shellscripts.html 
for a useful guide on creating a backup script and how to automate it with a cron job

* Cronjob
See https://askubuntu.com/questions/2368/how-do-i-set-up-a-cron-job
for a simple description of how to do cronjobs
* Commands
touch
 Adds some file or dir to the current dir. As opposed to opening a new
 file with a program
* Directories
/bin
 In either the linux fs or the application context, bin is just short
 for binaries

 In the downloaded application context, /bin is where the application
 stores its binaries (duh).

 In the linux fs context, this is where most of the system application
 binaries reside. Not exactly sure on the difference between this dir
 and the /usr/bin dir. At this point it's not that important
