#+TITLE: Notes on specific git packages

* tensorflow
 I decided to install using docker, which means...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Docker completely isolates the TensorFlow installation from
pre-existing packages on your machine. The Docker container contains
TensorFlow and all its dependencies. Note that the Docker image can be
quite large (hundreds of MBs). You might choose the Docker
installation if you are incorporating TensorFlow into a larger
application architecture that already uses Docker.
#+END_QUOTE

What that means for me is that to be able to run tensorflow, I just
have to run the following command:

 sudo docker run -it gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow bash

 When there, just enter the python terminal, import tensorflow, and voila
