#+TITLE: Notes on Helm (A Useful Package in Emacs)

* Useful Features
*** helm-find-file: 

ffap is a different package in Emacs and it is able to go to a file or
directory based on what is selected in the editor.

helm-find-files can do that too: all you need to do is move your point
onto a proper filepath, and Helm will reach the correct path for you,
similar to the screenshot. Now, you no longer have to use a separate
command to open the file at point, but using the same C-x C-f. It's
really convenient.
