#+TITLE: Hello world

/Note: Sometimes I will be taking notes from the emacs Editor Manual./
/If I want to return to a specific poriton in the manual, I will create a bookmark (C-x r b)/
/At the top of the section I am taking notes on, I will give the name of the bookmark/

* Emacs major/minor modes
** Themes
*** Color theme
**** If you load this file to a new distro without the color theme
addon installed, it's simply added by installing emacs-goodies-el:

sudo apt-get install emacs-goodies-el

*** Require the color-theme package.

After installing Color Theme, you can pick and choose from a menu. This menu can be accessed via ‘M-x color-theme-select’

To start emacs with the selected theme as default, change the 'color-theme-...' in the .emacs file

Some basic stuff to help w/ navigation. See info file for actual documentation

To skip to next page type 'n'. To go to previous page type 'p'

To enlarge or shrink the page, type '+' or '-' respetively
** flyspell-mode
Underline incorrectly spelled text

There are several options (see manual).

You can use several other minor modes which are similar that have
quite a bit of flexibility depending on what you want to do

* Misc 
** General
Filepath copy
 If you want to copy the current file path (including the filename) a
 shortcut is to just go to the *Messages* buffer after having saved
 said file and just copy the output.

 This is useful for if you want to create a link to a file in org mode
 for instance.

** Commands
*** M-: to evaluate a command
 A useful command to evaluate is "buffer-file-name". This will output
 the file path (+ filename) into the minibuffer. I have yet to figure
 out how to actually copy the minibufer text...
*** M-x rgrep
M-x rgrep allows you to search for text with external grep command and displays the results in a buffer. The good thing about running grep in Emacs is that the raw output are processed. The end results are colored and clickable, so that you can quickly visit the matched location!
