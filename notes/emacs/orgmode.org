* General
** external links
 To create an external link to a file as a reference, type 'file:'
 directly followed by the filepath. If you want to go to a specific
 line number, append '::NNN' to the end of the filepath (NNN=line
 number)

 See http://orgmode.org/manual/External-links.html for more info

** org-mode structure (Lists)
See this useful guide on creating lists
http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/org-mode-basics-structuring-your-notes/

All text copied below:...


Text in org is structured by headings, denoted by lines starting with
one or more * so we are currently in a section!

** A subheading
Starts with an extra * and so on

** navigation
Headings can be expanded or collapsed by moving to the (sub)heading
and pressing TAB. S-TAB cycles all headings. You can jump to next and
previous headings with C-c C-n and C-c C-p respectively.

You can move headings up and down to reorder them with the arrow keys,
using M-up or M-down. You can change the level of headings with M-left
and M-right (and use M-S-left and M-S-right to also change the levels
of and subheadings).

** lists
*** bullet lists
 - bullet lists can be created like this (start a line with one or
   more space and a -
 - pressing M-RET gives you a new bullet
 - we might also like nested bullets
   - like this one (I pressed M-RET TAB to indent it)
   - and another (M-RET now indents to the new level)
 - the nice thing is that for long lines of text, emacs wraps them
   so that they line up with the bullet
 - you can also reorder list items and change indentation using
   M-up or M-down just like with section headings
 - you can change bullet style using S-left and S-right

*** numbered lists
 1) numbered lists are also possible
 2) M-RET gives me a new number

*** checklists [/]
 - [ ] we can even have check lists
 - [ ] M-S-RET gives a new item with a check box
 - [ ] C-c C-c check/unchecks a box
 - [ ] you can have sub items
   + [ ] like this
   + [ ] that can be checked off individually
 - [ ] and you can track the number of items by adding [/] to the end
   of a line above a checklist - this updates when you check items off

*** definition lists
 - definition lists :: these are useful sometimes
 - item 2 :: M-RET again gives another item, and long lines wrap in a
      tidy way underneath the definition

** auto-fill mode
Sometimes when creating lists, the item is too big and emacs
wraps the line (when auto-fill mode is enabled). When this happens,
the text that spills over is not part of the item and breaks the
list. Just turn off auto-fill mode (M-x auto-fill-mode) and it won't
wrap the lines anymore and it'l work again
* Commands
** TAB
With the cursor on a collapsable item, press tab to toggle view of
sub-elements.
** SHIFT+TAB
Global visibility cycling.

Toggles the visibility of all items one level.
** _TODO item complete
If you want to mark a heading as a TODO item, just type 'TODO' in the
heading. Once it's done, type C-c C-t to mark complete

It'd be nice to figure out checkboxes to, just to know how
** Links
If you want to link to another file but don't want the whole filepath
listed, you can just write a description and hyperlink to said file:

[[link][description] 

Example:
[[/home/david/Documents/git/programming-math/notes/general.org][General notes]]

To actually open the link, move the cursor over the text and type C-c C-o
** #+BEGIN_SRC block
To insert a src block, enter the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
<s + TAB
#+END_SRC
** org-toggle-latex-fragment
#+BEGIN_SRC 
C-c C-x C-l
#+END_SRC

Use this command to create an image from a latex fragment. You can create a an image from ALL latex fragments in the subtree by running the command

#+BEGIN_SRC 
C-u C-c C-x C-l
#+END_SRC
